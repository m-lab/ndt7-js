# BrowserStack Reporting
# ======================
# The following capabilities are used to set up reporting on BrowserStack:
# Set 'projectName' to the name of your project. Example, Marketing Website
projectName: ndt7-js
# Set `buildName` as the name of the job / testsuite being run
buildName: ndt7-js E2E testing
# `buildIdentifier` is a unique id to differentiate every execution that gets appended to
# buildName. Choose your buildIdentifier format from the available expressions:
# ${BUILD_NUMBER} (Default): Generates an incremental counter with every execution
# ${DATE_TIME}: Generates a Timestamp with every execution. Eg. 05-Nov-19:30
# Read more about buildIdentifiers here -> https://www.browserstack.com/docs/automate/selenium/organize-tests
buildIdentifier: "#${BUILD_NUMBER}" # Supports strings along with either/both ${expression}

# Parallels per Platform
# =======================
# The number of parallel threads to be used for each platform set.
# BrowserStack's SDK runner will select the best strategy based on the configured value
#
# With 8 platforms and parallelsPerPlatform: 1, this will run 8 concurrent tests
# This fits within our BrowserStack plan limits (5 concurrent + 5 queued = 10 total)
# The SDK will automatically queue tests that exceed the concurrent limit
parallelsPerPlatform: 1

# ==========================================
# BrowserStack Local
# (For localhost, staging/private websites)
# ==========================================
# Set browserStackLocal to true if your website under test is not accessible publicly over the internet
# Learn more about how BrowserStack Local works here -> https://www.browserstack.com/docs/automate/selenium/local-testing-introduction
browserstackLocal: true # <boolean> (Default false)
# browserStackLocalOptions:
# Options to be passed to BrowserStack local in-case of advanced configurations
